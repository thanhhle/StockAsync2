# StockAsync
An application written in C#
Console and Textfile output are identical 


## Description
- This application involves delegates, events, and asynchronization
- Create an application that models the ups and downs of a particular stock. The value of a stock is assumed to change by plus or minus a specified number of units after every time unit (such as one hour). A notification is generated each time a stock changes more than a specified number of units above or below its intial value. A collection of brokers who control the stock must receive this notification. The range within which the stock can change every time unit and the threshold above or below which collection of brokers who control the stock must be notified are specified when the stock is created (using its constructor).

## Implementation
Define a delegate class StockNotification. This is shown below.

```code
public delegate void StockNotification(String stockName, int currentValue, int numberChanges);
```

This delegate is designed so that when an event of this type is fired, the stock's name, value, and the number of changes in value can be sent to the listener.


Create the class Stock with the following attributes:
- Stock name
- Stock intial value
- Maximum change (the range within a stock can change every time unit)
- Notification threshold (the threshold above or below  which the collection of brokers who control the stock must be notified)

Note: Implement other members in the class Stock that are needed.

When a stock object is created, an async method is called. This method causes the stock's value to be modified every 500 milliseconds. If its value changes from its initial value by more than the specified notification threshold, an event method is invoked. This invokes the stockEvent (of event-type StockNotification) and multicasts a  notification to all listeners who have registered with stockEvent.

Create another event to notify saving the following information to a file when the stock's threshold is reached: date and time, stock name, inital value and current value.

Create the class StockBroker which has fields broker name and stocks, a List of Stock. This latter field is not used in this application but could be used to obtain the stocks currently controlled by a given broker. The addStock method registers the Notify listerner with the stock (in addition to adding it to the list of stocks held by the broker). This Notify method outputs to the console the name, value, and the number of changes of the stock whose value is out of the range given the stock's notification threshold.

The listing below presents a main driver class, StockApplication.

```mainclass
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Stock stock1 = new Stock("Technology",160, 5, 15);
    Stock stock2 = new Stock("Retail",30, 2, 6);
    Stock stock3 = new Stock("Banking", 90, 4, 10);
    Stock stock4 = new Stock("Commodity", 500, 20, 50);

    StockBroker b1 = new StockBroker("Broker 1");
    b1.AddStock(stock1);
    b1.AddStock(stock2);

    StockBroker b2 = new StockBroker("Broker 2");
    b2.AddStock(stock1);
    b2.AddStock(stock3);
    b2.AddStock(stock4);

    StockBroker b3 = new StockBroker("Broker 3");
    b3.AddStock(stock1);
    b3.AddStock(stock3);

    StockBroker b4 = new StockBroker("Broker 4");
    b4.AddStock(stock1);
    b4.AddStock(stock2);
    b4.AddStock(stock3);
    b4.AddStock(stock4);
    
    await Task.WhenAll(stock1.Task, stock2.Task, stock3.Task, stock4.Task);
}
```
